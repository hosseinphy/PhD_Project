read_write_sources : Containes initial random configuration

sim_sources :  Contains AMR code along with plotting scripts

compile.sh : Compile and submit the code 				

run_plot.sh :  run python code	 (If you want to plot temperature field 
				  with random particles in a "moving window", 
				  use ploatad_comov.py in /sim_sources/plotad.sh
			          ***********************************************
				  If you want to plot temperature, concenteration 
				  (not applicable for Le->inf), and 1D temperature 
				  of concentration profile use plotad3.py in /sim_sources/plotad.sh)
